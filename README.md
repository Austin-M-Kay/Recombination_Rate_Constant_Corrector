# Recombination_Rate_Constant_Corrector

An open-source, Jupyter-based script for correcting bimolecular recombination rate constants determined as a function of the extracted carrier density (using a least-squares method). This script was created to support the following work:

_A New Framework for Understanding Recombination-Limited Charge Extraction in Disordered Semiconductors_
